# MobCal-MPI 2.0.3

MobCal-MPI is a parallelized version of the widely-used MobCal suite, designed for calculating ion mobilities and collision cross sections (2.0).

## Fortran code Compilation Instructions

Detailed compilation instructions on high-performance computing (HPC) and standalone Unix platforms are provided in the [MobCal-MPI 2.0.1 manual](/Manual/MobCal-MPI_User_manual.pdf). For the convenience of users who do not have access to HPC architecture, we have also provided a [Quick Guide](/Manual/Quick%20Guide%20for%20installing%20Intel%20OneAPI%20to%20compile%20Fortran%20code.pdf) for installing Intel OneAPI and the associate mpiifort compiler to local Unix systems.

## GUI 
A [GUI](/GUI/Launcher.py) is provided to streamline the creation and analysis of MobCal-MPI files. Detailed documentation is provided in the [manual](/Manual/MobCal-MPI_User_manual.pdf), although for users who desire a QuickStart workflow, the GUI requires the following prerequisites to load:

- **Python 3.12+**: Download and install from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **GitHub Desktop**: Download from [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Please install Git to the default location and add to PATH if prompted to do so. A GitHub account is not required for installation.
- **Git**: Download from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/). Please install Git to the default location and add to PATH if prompted to do so. A GitHub account is not required for installation.
- **OpenBabel 2.4.1**: Download and install from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openbabel/files/openbabel/2.4.1/) to the default location and add the download location to your system's PATH.
- **SDF2XYZ2SDF**: Download and install from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdf2xyz2sdf/files/binaries/windows/) to the default location and add the download location to your system's PATH.

The GUI also requires several Python packages. Install them using the following command in your command prompt:

```console
pip install numpy pyqt6 scipy matplotlib gitpython
```

## Changes in v2.0.3
- Modified submission procedure. File names for input and output are now taken directly from command line arguments, not from an external file. Example:

    ```bash
    ./MobCal_MPI_203.exe Acetaminophen.mfj Acetaminophen.mout
    ```

## Changes in v2.0.2
- Fixed a bug in the Fortran source code impacting compilation via OneAPI. 
- Added update funtionality to the MobCal-MPI GUI, informing users of when updates are pushed to GitHub.
- Fixed minor bugs within the GUI.
- Updated Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of the MobCal-MPI manual to describe the above changes.

## Changes in v2.0.1
The latest release, v2.0.1, builds upon its predecessor by incorporating two-temperature theory (2TT) to accurately compute ion mobilities and CCSs at arbitrary field strengths. It addresses fixes to the GUI and some compilation errors. The release also includes a detailed manual covering the GUI's functionality, compiling the MobCal-MPI Fortran code on various Unix platforms, and an Appendix providing a step-by-step tutorial on calculating an ion's CCS from scratch.

## Version 2.0.0
- Implementation of two-temperature theory (2TT) within the MobCal-MPI framework.
- Empirical correction to 2TT to rectify systematic deviations between calculated and experimental high-field mobilities.
- Updated methodology for evaluating uncertainty in CCS calculated from the trajectory method.
- Changed the nature of the grid for ion-neutral relative velocities sampling from weighted spacing to linear spacing.
- Fixed a bug where the temperature for weighting the N2 rotational orientations was fixed at 500 K instead of being determined at Tbath.
